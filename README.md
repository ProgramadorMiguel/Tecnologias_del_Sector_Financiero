# Financial Sector Technologies — Java & Distributed Systems

This repository showcases a collection of **hands-on implementations** focused on technologies and patterns commonly used in the **financial services industry**, including **Java, Maven, messaging, event-driven architectures, latency handling, and distributed data processing**.

The project demonstrates my ability to **design, implement, and reason about production-oriented systems**, with emphasis on **performance, scalability, and correctness**, rather than purely theoretical code.

---

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools

Across the different modules, the following technologies and concepts are applied:

- **Java** (core language, object-oriented design)
- **Maven** (multi-module project structure, dependency management)
- **Event-driven architectures**
- **Publish / Subscribe messaging patterns**
- **Latency-sensitive processing**
- **Asynchronous communication**
- **Distributed data processing concepts**
- **Protocol-based communication (e.g. Protobuf)**
- **Clean code and modular design**
- **IntelliJ IDEA** as the development environment

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is structured as a set of **independent modules**, each representing a self-contained implementation focused on a specific technical problem or architectural concept:

```text
Lesson1/
Lesson2/
Lesson3/
Lesson4/
Lesson5/
Lesson6/
Lesson7/
Lesson8/
Lesson9/
Lesson10/
Lesson11/
Lesson12/
Lesson13/
Lesson14/
```

Each module is an **independent Maven project** (except Lesson11/ Lesson13/ Lesson14/), allowing isolated execution, testing, and analysis.

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

### Software Engineering Skills
- Ability to structure **clean, modular Java projects**
- Proper use of **build tools and dependency management**
- Clear separation of concerns and reusable components

### Distributed & Event-Based Systems
- Implementation of **publish/subscribe mechanisms**
- Handling of **event streams and message consumers**
- Design of **listeners, processors, and subscribers**
- Awareness of **latency and throughput trade-offs**

### Performance & Data Processing
- Processing of **time-sensitive data**
- Measurement and handling of **latency metrics**
- Volume-based and event-based processing strategies
- Stateless vs stateful processing considerations

### Real-World Financial Context
- Patterns inspired by **market data distribution**
- Event processing similar to **order flow, measurements, and streams**
- Technologies and approaches aligned with **real trading and fintech systems**

## 🛠️ Build & Execution

Each module can be built independently:

```bash
mvn clean compile
```
Modules can be executed either:

- Directly from **IntelliJ IDEA**
- Or via standard **Maven lifecycle commands**

---

## 📈 Why This Matters

This repository reflects my ability to:

- Work with **production-like codebases**
- Understand **non-trivial system behavior** (latency, events, concurrency)
- Apply **engineering judgment**, not just write code
- Adapt to **financial-sector technical requirements**

It is intended as a **technical portfolio** rather than a single application.
